# sql-challenge

#table schemata are in schema.sql; queries to answer 8 questions are in queries.sql

#Note: When importing the department_employees table, pgAdmin set the column names in the Columns tab
#of the import panel incorrectly, but had them in reverse order. Simply deleting these allowed me to import the data successfully.
#Maybe it was b/c I had the columns in the wrong order when I first constructed the table, though I dropped the table many times
#since I made the original mistake and it would keep setting the columns in the columns tab (it didn't try setting them at all for other tables), 
#and still incorrectly.
